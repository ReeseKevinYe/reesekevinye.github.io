I'm Reese Ye, an apsiring analyst, self motivated and driven in nature. I was born and still live in Sydney, Australia. I am currently a 3rd year student and expected to complete my degree by 2023 with honours in Artifical intellignece and Data Analytics. My current employment at the Australian Taxation Office has provided me a wealth in developing my numerical analytical abilities. 

As a result it has sparked me to focus more on appilicable analytics such as identifying how data can be changed into actionable insights and how it can improve the community or increase a business KPI. 

<b> Currently I am looking for opportunities in analytics </b> such as data analyst or consulting. However, I am open to new prospects. 

Outside of work in my free time, I pursue in various activties such as: 

<ul>
  <li>Keeping up to date with daily economic and financial news</li>
  <li>Reading at least 1 - 2 research papers in a week</li>
  <li>Spending time with family and friends</li>
</ul>
