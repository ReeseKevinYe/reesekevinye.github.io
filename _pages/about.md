I'm Reese Ye, an apsiring analyst, self motivated and driven in nature.

I'm currently a 3rd year student and expected to complete my degree by 2023 with honours in Artifical intellignece and Data Analytics at University of Technology Sydney.

My current employment at the Australian Taxation Office has provided me a wealth of knoweldge and experience in developing my numerical analytical abilities and understanding of taxation and finance in Australia. 

As a result it has sparked me to focus more on appilicable analytics such as identifying how data can be changed into actionable insights and how it can improve the community or increase a business KPI. 

<b> Currently I am looking for opportunities in analytics such as data analyst or consulting. However, I am open to new prospects. </b>

Outside of work in my free time, I pursue in various activties such as: 

<ul>
  <li>Keeping up to date with daily economic and financial news</li>
  <li>Reading at least 1 - 2 research papers in a week</li>
  <li>Spending time with family and friends</li>
</ul>

In my github website, I have my <a href="https://reesekevinye.github.io/cv/">online resume</a> and the <a href="https://reesekevinye.github.io/projects/">projects</a> that I have completed, which includes Python, R, and Excel. Feel Free to check them out!
